## Scripts
### Manual Miner (./manual\_miner)
A simple script to create pseudo blocks that resemble a blockchain. With block number, hash to previous block, and optional list of transactions as input, the miner can create the hash of the new block. This exercise demonstrates how blocks and miners work.

This example has been simplified and should not be used in any production
system.
